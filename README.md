# M0_Digital_Eyes
Project files for digital eyes using AdaFruit ItsyBitsy M0 Express

Not my original code- copied from AdaFruit.

I made the AdaFruit Eyes project with a Raspberry Pi and the Eyes Bonnet, which worked great, but I found the full sized Pi too bulky to cram into a skull. 
Later I came across the UncannyEyes project (https://github.com/adafruit/Uncanny_Eyes) using an ItsyBitsy board- much smaller and cheaper, with on board memory and low power draw. There is also virtually no boot up time, and the performance was way better than the Pi Zero. 

This repository is mostly for my own reference when doing any maintenance on these or expirimenting with other displays.
